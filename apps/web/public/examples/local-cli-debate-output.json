						"reasoning": "Transparency in AI decision-making is fundamental to building trust and ensuring accountability. When AI systems make recommendations or decisions that affect people's lives—whether in healthcare, finance, or criminal justice—users deserve to understand the basis for those outputs.\n\nThis isn't just about satisfying curiosity; it's about enabling meaningful human oversight and catching potential errors or biases before they cause harm. The technical challenges are real but not insurmountable. Techniques like attention visualization, feature attribution, and counterfactual explanations have made significant progress.\n\nMoreover, requiring explanations creates healthy pressure on AI developers to build more interpretable systems from the start, rather than treating explainability as an afterthought.",

						"positionText": "Mandatory explanation requirements would be counterproductive, potentially reducing AI capability and creating a false sense of understanding.",
						"reasoning": "While the goal of transparency is admirable, mandatory explanation requirements could backfire in several ways.\n\nFirst, the most capable AI systems—like large language models and deep neural networks—are inherently difficult to explain in human-understandable terms. Forcing simplified explanations risks either providing misleading post-hoc rationalizations that don't reflect the actual computation, or constraining developers to use less capable but more interpretable methods.\n\nSecond, explanations can create dangerous overconfidence. Users who receive an explanation may assume they fully understand the system's reasoning, when in reality the explanation is an approximation at best.\n\nThird, regulatory mandates tend to be blunt instruments that don't account for context. A chess engine explaining its moves is very different from a medical diagnosis system.",

						"reasoning": "Both sides raise valid points, but the practical path forward lies in calibrating explanation requirements to the context. Not all AI applications are equal in their potential for harm or their need for transparency.\n\nFor high-stakes decisions—medical diagnoses, loan approvals, criminal sentencing—robust explanation requirements make sense. Users affected by these decisions have a legitimate interest in understanding why.\n\nFor lower-stakes applications—content recommendations, spam filtering, autocomplete—extensive explanation requirements would be overkill. The marginal benefit doesn't justify the engineering effort.\n\nThe EU's AI Act takes this tiered approach, and it's the right framework. We should focus on defining clear criteria for what constitutes 'high-risk' AI.",

						"reasoning": "I want to introduce a perspective neither side has fully addressed: the adversarial dimension of explainability.\n\nIf we mandate explanations, we create an incentive for AI developers to optimize for *plausible-sounding* explanations rather than *accurate* ones. This is especially concerning because explanations are often generated post-hoc by separate systems.\n\nMoreover, bad actors could use explanation requirements to reverse-engineer and game AI systems. If a loan approval AI must explain why it rejected an application, that information could be used to craft fraudulent applications that game the criteria.\n\nWe should be cautious about assuming that more explanation automatically means more trust or safety.",

The default assumption should be that explanations are required, with clear criteria for exemptions.\n\nI also want to respond to the contrarian's point about gaming.

There's a tendency for regulatory scope to expand over time, eventually capturing applications where the burden of explanation outweighs the benefit.\n\nSecond, explanation requirements must be technically feasible and actually useful. Mandating explanations that current technology can't reliably provide would be counterproductive.\n\nThird, we need mechanisms for developers to demonstrate compliance without revealing proprietary model details.\n\nWith these guardrails, I can support a risk-tiered approach.",

Let me synthesize the key elements that seem to have broad support:\n\n1. **Tiered requirements**: Different explanation standards for different risk levels, with high-stakes applications facing the most stringent requirements.\n\n2. **Default toward transparency**: The burden should be on developers to justify opacity, not on regulators to justify requirements.\n\n3. **Technical feasibility safeguards**: Requirements must be achievable with current technology, while also creating incentives for interpretability research.\n\n4. **Regular review**: Risk categories and explanation standards should be revisited as we learn more about real-world AI impacts.\n\n5. **Anti-gaming measures**: As the contrarian noted, we need safeguards against explanation manipulation.\n\nThis framework balances the genuine need for transparency with practical realities.",

The proposed framework does attempt to address them.\n\nHowever, I want to maintain some skepticism about implementation. History shows that well-intentioned regulations often have unintended consequences. The definition of 'high-risk' will inevitably be contested and politicized.\n\nThat said, I recognize that perfect shouldn't be the enemy of good.
