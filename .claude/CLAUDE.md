# Project Instructions

## Git Workflow

you can create a small chunks of commit that makes sense. always use conventional commit stlye.
**Never push without explicit user permission.** Always wait for the user to approve before running `git push`.
Omit the generated by Claude text from commits. Unless stated otherwise you can create commits but do not push without permission.

## Documentation

If unsure about project patterns, architecture, or conventions, check the `docs/` folder first.

## Code Standards

See [docs/code-standards.md](../docs/code-standards.md) for Biome/Ultracite linting rules and code style guidelines.

Quick commands:

- **Lint check**: `bun run lint`
- **Lint and fix**: `bun run lint:fix`
- **Format code**: `bun run format`

Pre-commit hooks (via husky + lint-staged) automatically run `biome check --write` on staged files.

## TypeScript Checking

Use `tsgo` instead of `tsc` for faster type checking. tsgo is a native Go port of TypeScript that's significantly faster.

```bash
# From app directory (e.g., apps/web)
bunx tsgo --noEmit

# Or from root for specific package
cd apps/web && bunx tsgo --noEmit
```

Note: Run from the specific app directory to avoid bun-types resolution issues at root level.

## Testing

When adding meaningful new features, cover them with tests. See [docs/testing.md](../docs/testing.md) for patterns.

## Specs

if you're writing specs or prd (using skills for example) output them into /spec fodler with the convention
of [date]-[short feature name]-spec.md

when you're done implenmenting a spec partially or fully , add a comment inside the spec on
when was it implemented and a commit name/sha if its commited

## Package Reuse

Do not reinvent the wheel - reuse packages from `/packages`:
